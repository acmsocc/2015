\section{Introduction}

A paragraph of text goes here.  Lots of text. More text.  Plenty of interesting
text. 

\section{This section has subsections}

\subsection{New subsection}

Sometimes you want to really call attention to a piece of text.  You
can center it in the column like this:
\begin{center}
{\tt \_1008e614\_Vector\_p}
\end{center}
and people will really notice it.\\

\noindent
The noindent at the start of this paragraph makes it clear that it's
a continuation of the preceding text, not a new para in its own right.

Now this is an ingenious way to get a forced space.
{\tt Real~$*$} and {\tt double~$*$} are equivalent. 

Now here is another way to call attention to a line of code, but instead
of centering it, we noindent and bold it.\\

\noindent
{\bf \tt size\_t : fread ptr size nobj stream } \\

And here we have made an indented para like a definition tag (dt)
in HTML.  You don't need a surrounding list macro pair.
\begin{itemize}
\item[]  {\tt fread} reads from {\tt stream} into the array {\tt ptr} at
most {\tt nobj} objects of size {\tt size}.   {\tt fread} returns
the number of objects read. 
\end{itemize}
This concludes the definitions tag.

\section{This is another section}

This is an example of unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
followed by another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}

Now we're going to cite somebody~\cite{smith02}.  Watch for the cite tag.  The tilde character (\~{}) in the source means a non-breaking space.  This way, your reference will always be attached to the word that preceded it, instead of going to the next line.

\section{Conclusions}

Well, it's getting boring isn't it.  This is the last section
where we wrap it up.
