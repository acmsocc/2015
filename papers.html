              The scope of SoCC is broad and encompasses diverse data management and systems topics such as software
              as a service, virtualization, scalable cloud data services, and data management and analytics at scale.
              Many facets of systems and data management issues must be revisited in the context of cloud computing.
              Suggested topics for paper submissions include but are not limited to:
            </p>
            <a id="submission"><h2>Paper submission</h2></a>
            <p>
              Authors are invited to submit original papers that are not being considered for publication in any other
              forum. A submission to the symposium may be one of the following types.
            </p>
            <h3>Research papers</h3>
            <p>
              Original research work in the broad area of cloud computing. We solicit both <b>long</b> papers (12 pages)
              and <b>short</b> papers (6 pages). The former will tend to be descriptions of complete technical work, while
              the latter will tend to be descriptions of interesting, innovative ideas, which nevertheless require more
              work to mature.
            </p>
            <h3>Industrial papers</h3>
            <p>
              Presentations describing experiences with the deployed and state-of-the-art cloud systems. These papers can
              also be either <b>long</b> papers (12 pages) or <b>short</b> papers (6 pages).
            </p>

            <h3>Vision papers</h3>
            <p>
              Speculative but well-reasoned and thought-provoking essays. We will only consider <b>short</b> papers (6 pages)
              in this category.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              All SoCC submissions will be held to a high quality standard, and evaluated based on their originality, technical
              merit, topical relevance, value to the community, and likelihood of leading to insightful technical discussions
              at the symposium. Submissions will be kept confidential. On rare occasions, <b>long</b> paper submissions may be
              accepted as <b>short</b> papers (pending authors’ approval and significant shortening).
            </p>

            <a id="guidelines"><h2>Submission guidelines</h2></a>
            <p>
              Papers must meet the following formatting rules in order to be considered for publication. They should be submitted
              in PDF format and formatted in 10-point type using the templates provided below. We cannot give extensions
              for reformatting.
            </p>

            <h3>Page limit</h3>
            <p>
              Long papers can be a maximum of <b>12 pages</b> while short papers can be a maximum of <b>6 pages</b>. These limits
              limits exclude references but include all other content (e.g., appendices)
            </p>

            <h3>Paper type</h3>
            <p>
              Following the list of author names and affiliations on the first page, submissions should include a line that specifies
              the paper’s “type” (research, industrial, or vision) and “length” (long or short).
            </p>

            <h3>Paper format & fonts</h3>
            <p>
              For formatting, please use this <a href="assets/socc15.cls">style file</a>. An example latex file using the style can
              be downloaded from <a href="assets/template.tex">here</a>. Please keep \usepackage{mathptmx} to get the correct math
              mode font.
            </p>

                    Papers must be formatted using a 10pt font on 12pt leading for letter-sized (8.5" by 11") paper. The text blocks must
                    follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with each column 9.25" by 3.33"; leave a 0.33" space between columns.

                    some people cannot distinguish some colors.  Figures should be clear when printed in black & white.

                <li><p>Symbols and axis labels used in graphs should be legible as printed, and not require magnification.</p></li>
                <li><p>Limit the file size to less than 15 MB.</p></li>
                <li><p>Please read and follow <a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/latex.html">this advice</a>.</p></li>

            <a id="process"><h2>Review process</h2></a>
            <p>
              Reviewing is single-blind: author identities need not be concealed. All papers will be shepherded, and papers will only be
              accepted for publication pending shepherd’s approval.
            </p>
