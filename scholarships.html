              Generous donations from our sponsors enable us to offer scholarships to assist students attending the conference. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Each student scholarship covers either a travel or a registration scholarship. To cover the rest of the costs of attending SoCC, 
              applicants must show the availability of additional support from their institutions (e.g., support from advisors). This must be stated 
              in the letter of recommendation from student’s advisor (more below). 
            </p>

            <p>
              Applicants are also encouraged to participate in the poster session and work-in-progress presentations. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Funding is available to students from any educational institution in the world (with the following exception: the subset of recipients 
              for whom the scholarship will be paid through a grant obtained by the organizers from NSF must be from U.S. institutions and must abide 
              by Fly America; i.e., fly US flag carriers).  
            </p>
            <a id="howtoapply"><h2>How to apply</h2></a>
            <p>
              To apply, please submit two emails, as follows, to 
            </p>

            <p><a href=mailto:SoCC-2015-scholarships@googlegroups.com>SoCC-2015-scholarships@googlegroups.com</a></p>

            <p>
              one from the student and the other from student's advisor.

              The email subject <b>must</b> have the format “Firstname Lastname (institution domain name in lower case)”. For example “John Doe (uchicago.edu)”. 
              The email doesn't need to have any body content, but it must have 2 PDF attachments, containing:

            <p>
              <ul>

                    the conference, describe any research that you have done, and list any published
                    papers. This statement should be no longer than one page, and should be attached
                    in PDF with filename format <u>inst-first-last-statement.pdf</u> (where inst =
                    institution domain name, first = first name, last = last name, all in lower
                    case).  For example, <u>uchicago-john-doe-statement.pdf</u>.

              <a href="mailto:SoCC-2015-scholarships@googlegroups.com">SoCC-2015-scholarships@googlegroups.com</a>. It must have the same subject 
              plus the word “Recommendation” (For example, “John Doe (uchicago.edu) Recommendation”). The letter can be in PDF, or just in the body of the email. 
            </p>

            <p>This letter must describe the technical appropriateness of the student's
              participation, and any partial support from other sources (e.g., the student's
              institution) available to cover the costs of the student attending SoCC. Advisors
