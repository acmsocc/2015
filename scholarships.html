              The goal of the student scholarships is to increase student attendance, while attracting the best and the brightest students in the area of cloud computing.
              Generous donations from our sponsors enable us to offer scholarships to assist students attending the conference. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Each student scholarship covers registration and partial travel expenses. To cover the rest of the costs of attending SoCC, 
              applicants must show the availability of additional support from their institutions (e.g., support from advisors). This must be stated 
              in the form to be submitted by the student’s advisor (more below). 
            </p>

            <p>
              Applicants are also encouraged to participate in the poster session and work-in-progress presentations. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Funding is available to students from any educational institution in the world. The subset of recipients
              for whom the scholarship will be paid using the U.S. National Science Foundation grant must be from U.S institutions and must 
              and must abide by Fly America rules; i.e., on US-flagged carriers).
